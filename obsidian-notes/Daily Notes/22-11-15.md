## Quick notes

Are containers deployed/replaced one-by-one and next is replaced only if previously replaced one is working properly, or all are replaced at once? (edited) 

The first approach we had in ec2 and it was useful to stop deployment if newly deployed instance is miss-behaving. then remaining instances with old code continue serving traffic without downtime. (edited)
