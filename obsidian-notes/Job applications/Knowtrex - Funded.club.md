- Funded.club is some kind of hub -- hiring service provider
- Knowtrex is data crunching SaaS shop
- Small, startup like still (impression after initial conversation with recruiter) 
- I asked for 140K - recruiter says they are looking up to 100K
  - We'll see if there is another round

Questions to ask if there is second round:
- What is Lead Backend developer?
- What are the values in organization?
- How is engineering organized? (product manager, project manager, eng manager)
- Why functional language? Why dynamically typed language?
- What is the product (a lot of data but for what)?
