### Position

- Back-End Developer at SoundLines
- $150k – $200k

SoundLines is saving healthcare providers from burnout by building the first truly ambient documentation assistant on the market. No trigger words or interaction with our assistant is necessary: providers walk into the room, start the visit, and forget about the device. Our customers love the product and we're growing quickly:

-   "This is stupid easy"
-   “The notes are way better than the ones I do on my own”
-   “10,000 times better than transcription”

Our backend is Elixir/Phoenix while our frontend is mostly VueJS. We are looking for experienced software engineers who are comfortable owning projects end-to-end, from ideation to release.

As a back end engineer on the SoundLines team, you will use your skills to create a crucial part of the company's product. In this role you would have direct input into the design and development of our back-end. Our team's philosophy: Simplicity is hard ... and mandatory.
