- How about we ask some some reallt competent BEAM expert (Sasa) to give his vision on how to evolve system without getting to a place where BEAM is useless ?

### Engineer in test
- Test eng to work long term on (be responcible for) testing framework
- In the meantime that person (instead of product) can be responcible for 
  - manual testing of the system
  - overseeing deployment
