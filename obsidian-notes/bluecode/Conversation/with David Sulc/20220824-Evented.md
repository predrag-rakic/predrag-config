# Evented

## David's position
- Remove commands concept from Evented.
- Create API that can be used to inject event(s) into the system.
- Hybrid-handler then becomes "Evented event-handler" or just event-handler
	 - That's its functionality. Since there can be more event-handlers, this one (the only one currently) needs to be assigned some descriptive name, yet to be defined.
  - Response type of event-handler is list-of-events (the list can be empty).


Maybe to rename hybrid-handler to event-processor. It consists of:
- event-handler and
- event-injector.
