### API SLAs

- We don't have them
- We need them
- By SLA I mean API latency guaranties 
  - "For this API call, BC promises to deliver response within n seconds"
- SLAs would/will help increase quolity of the product, because latency translates directly into quality:
   - Currently nobody in product cares about latency, only about features.
   - If I want to work on latency (roughly quality) I have to fight product for time 
     - and I loose that fight mostly
   - If SLA is part of the deal, when SLA is violated product makes a ticket and prioritizes it.
