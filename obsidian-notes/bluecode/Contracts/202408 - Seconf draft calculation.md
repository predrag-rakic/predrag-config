Currrent salary: 105K/year

- 52 weeks per year = 365 total days * 5/7 = 260 working days 
- 5 weeks vacation = 25 working days
- 12 days public holidays (from timetastic) * 5/7 = 9 

Really working days: 260 - 25 - 9 = 226 
Daily rate: 105K/226 = 465E

What about:
- Equipment stipend?
- sick days ("I dont feel well, I'll take it slow today")
