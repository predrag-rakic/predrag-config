Research shows that average human can produce pretty much constant number of lines of code (LoC) regardless of the language.
(This metric cannot be applied on day-to-day work but is quite accurate over longer periods of time.)

Consequence: One can program in in assembly, C or some high-level language, number of LoC written daily won't change dramatically.

Conclusion: If the goal is to increase developer efficiency, meaning of single LoC has to be enriched
-> Expressiveness of the language/library has to be increased
-> Constructs that allow developer to think/develop on higher level have to be introduced
