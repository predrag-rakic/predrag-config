# Interview with Sergey


Nice person, with not ideal but acceptable English.
Has ~10 years of experience but shows lack of ability for conceptual thinking and formation of generalized views based on the experience.
My impression is that we can and should look for a better candidate.

I'm not inclined to hire.

- 

Did not think about test coverage

- from book: unit tests the most coverage, after that integration test, after that ...

  

API

Sync vs Asunc

something but cannot give me straight pros and cons(not even pro and con)

Retry:

- Thinking about resources, ok

- Idempotency? Only from the book

  
  

Never on-call rotation

  
  

About interview with Sergey:

If we are in rush, he is ok (though I'm not trilled with shotgun hiring).

If we are not, Sergey is not my first choice.

He has like 10 years of prod experience and I got much better responses from Gustavo.

On all accounts, including English.
